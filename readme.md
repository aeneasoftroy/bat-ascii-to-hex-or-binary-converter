This batch script is for converting ASCII values to HEX or BINARY, multiple usages allowed:

1. if there's no input, the script will ask for it.
2. input as parameter is accepted. (script.bat THIS_IS_WHAT_I_WANT_TO_CONVERT, this mode has problems with handling spaces!)
3. a echo pipe is also allowed. (echo THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO CONVERT|script.bat)
